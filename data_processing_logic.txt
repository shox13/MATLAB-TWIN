Let's process data! Yeaaahhhh!

----------

You have data that you want to process, you should know are few things about your data:

1. Name of the file

2. Location of the file

3. File format (it must be changed to CSV. we can change it to something else, but it requires different libraries). 

4. How many parameters are there? Are they collecting simulatenously? If yes, good. If no, you will have an issue when comparing your data. (T_T)

psuedo code >>('3')<<:

2. Get sample data from csv. file (location, please).

more specifically:

1. YoU have contiounous data of of reoocuring cycles.

2. Cycle # is determined when the voltage reach 0V.

3. You will need to break of the data there.
